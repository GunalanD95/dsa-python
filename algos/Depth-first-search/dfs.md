# Depth First Search Alogrithm

## Depth first Search or Depth first traversal is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure. Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph.


#### A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:

#### Visited
#### Not Visited

## The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

### The DFS algorithm works as follows:

#### Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
#### Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
#### Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
#### Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty



## Application of DFS

#### Optimizations for creteria (cost, time, space,safety)

### Pathfinding
